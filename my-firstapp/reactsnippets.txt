# Short notes on react.

# --> Components are created with 'React.createClass()' 
# --> render() method produces the real ouput and is always placed at the very end.
# --> JSX is in play bcs the return value has to be in parenthesis.
# --> the 'class' attr is discouraged, instead use className
# --> JS expressions used as attr val must be enclosed in curly braces.
# --> it is always good to set initial values for the state
# --> Components pass properties to their children Components through the use of 'props' or properties.
# --> Note: props should never be used to determine the state of Components.
# --> 

# --> useState is for state management. Uses fuction based component.
# --> useEffect is for life cycle management. substitutes the use of componentWillMount, componentWillUpdate, componentWillUnmount
